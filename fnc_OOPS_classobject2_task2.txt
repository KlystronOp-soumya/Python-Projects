2. Classes and Objects 2 - Task 2
Polymorphism

 

1. Define a class 'rectangle' with two methods 'display' and 'area'.

- Define the method 'display' such that it will Print the message "This is a Rectangle" upon calling.

- Define the method 'area' which takes 2 parameters 'Length' and 'Breadth' and find the area of the rectangle and Print as "Area of Rectangle is 144".

 

2. Define a class 'square' with two methods 'display' and 'area'.

- Define the method 'display' such that it will Print the message "This is a Square" upon calling.

- Define the method 'area' which takes a single parameter 'Side' and find the area of the square and Print as "Area of square is 169".

 

Note

Only the above 2 steps are to be followed while writing the code.

Printing the output will be taken care of while testing by creating objects for both the classes 'rectangle' and 'square and calling the methods with sample inputs as arguments.

 

Input Format for Custom Testing

The first line should contain the value for 'Length'.

The second line should contain the value for 'Breadth'.

The third line should contain the value for 'Side'.
