Python - Prime Number Generator

 

Define a function called `primegenerator`, which takes two parameters. The parameter 'num' is an integer and is the range up to which the prime number must be generated, and the parameter 'val' contains either 0 or 1. The function definition code stub is given in the editor. Use the concept of generators to yield prime numbers based on the following conditions:

 

The prime numbers for the 'num' value of 21 are
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
If the value of 'val' is 0, then you should yield the following values
3 7 13 19
If the value of 'val' is 1, then you should yield the following values
2 5 11 17
Constraints

The 'num' value is inclusive.

 

Input Format Format for Custom Testing

 

In the first line, 'num' is given.
In the second line, 'val' is given.
 

Sample Case 0

 

Sample Input

STDIN      Function
-----      --------
21       →  num = 21
1        →  val = 1

Sample Output

2 5 11 17 
Explanation

With 21 as input,  2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19  are generated. Since 1 is odd, we take the odd positions from the result.
Thus 2 5 11 17  is generated.
