1. Magic Constant Generator
Magic Constant 'M'

 

A magic square is an arrangement of numbers in a square, where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal will be equal to the same number. For example, if the number of rows and columns in a magic square is "n", then it will have n*n numbers.

You can create a magic square of any number 'n' except when n = 2. The constant which is the sum of every row, column, and diagonal is called the magic constant, M. Every magic square will have this constant M, which is based on the value of n. The smallest 'nontrivial' case, which is a 3x3 square, has a magic constant of 15.

 



 

 If n = 3, then M = 15. If n = 4, then M = 34, and so on.

The magic constants, are from n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8:

...15, 34, 65, 111, 175, 260

 

Write the function definition for the generator named 'generator_Magic', which takes a single parameter 'n1', an Integer.

1. Define the above Generator such that it should yield the Magic constant(s) for the values starting from 3 to 'n1'.

 

Note

Printing the output will be taken care of during testing, so you need not print the Magic constants yielded by generator 'generator_Magic' and its Type.

 

Input Format for Custom Testing

Single line input for the parameter 'n'.

Output Explanation

First, it will print the Magic Constant Series one-by-one.

Then, it will print the Type of 'gen1' returned by the function.
