1. Classes and Objects 1 - Task 1
Cinema Ticket

1. Define a class 'Movie' that represents Name of the Movie, Number of Tickets, and the Total cost of a movie ticket printing machine.

Hint

Define the initializer method, __init__, that takes three values and assigns them to the above 3 attributes, respectively.

2. Improvise the class definition of 'Movie' such that any Movie object is displayed in the following format:

Sample:

Movie : Kabir Singh
Number of Tickets : 5
Total Cost : 666

Hint: Define the method __str__ inside the class 'Movie'.

 

Note

1. Only the above 2 steps are to be followed while writing the code.

2. Printing the output will be taken care while testing by creating an object for the class 'Movie' with sample inputs as arguments and printing the object.

 

Input Format for Custom Testing

The first line should contain the value for 'Name of the movie'.
