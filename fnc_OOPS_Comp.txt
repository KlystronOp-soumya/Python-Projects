2. Classes and Objects 1 - Task 2
Addition and Subtraction of Complex Numbers

 

1. Define the class 'comp' that represents the Real and Imaginary parts of a complex number. For example, for the complex number "2+3i", 2 is the real part, and 3 is the imaginary part. 

Hint:

Define the initializer method, __init__, that takes 2 values and assigns them to the above 2 attributes, respectively.

 

2. Define a method 'add' inside the class 'comp', which determines the sum of two complex numbers and Print the sum as "Sum of the two Complex numbers :35+47i"

 

3. Define a method 'sub' inside the class 'comp', which determines the difference of two complex numbers and Print the difference as "Subtraction of the two Complex numbers :-33-43i" 

Note: Subtract the second complex number from the first.

 

Note

Only the above 3 steps are to be followed while writing the code.

Printing the output will be taken care of while testing by creating two different objects for the class 'comp' with sample inputs as arguments and calling the methods.

 

Input Format for Custom Testing

The first line should contain the value for the 'real' part of the first complex number.

The second line should contain the value for the 'imaginary' part of the first complex number.

The third line should contain the value for the 'real' part of the second complex number.

The fourth line should contain the value for the 'imaginary' part of the second complex number.
