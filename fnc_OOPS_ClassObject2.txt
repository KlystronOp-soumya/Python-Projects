1. Classes and Objects 2 - Task 1
Inheritance - Parent and Children Shares

 

This hands-on is about dividing a family's total assets within the family members based on a percentage.

1. Parents will always inherit 50% of the family's total asset worth.

2. The son will inherit a percentage of the family's total asset worth indicated by the input value ' Percentage_for_son'.

3. The daughter will inherit a percentage of the family's total asset worth indicated by the input value ' Percentage_for_daughter'.

 

The definition for the parent class 'parent' will be already given in the coding section.

 

1. Define a class 'son' derived from the class 'parent'.

- Inherit the init function from the parent class and add a variable 'Percentage_for_son', which indicates the percentage of the inheritance he will get from the family's total asset worth.

- Define a method 'son_display', which will Print the share of the son rounded off to 2 decimal places, for example, "Share of Son is 2.0 Million."

 

2. Define a class 'daughter' derived from the class 'parent'.

- Inherit the init function from the parent class and add a variable 'Percentage_for_daughter', which indicates the percentage of the inheritance she will get from the family's total asset worth.

- Define a method 'daughter_display', which will Print the share of the daughter rounded off to 2 decimal places, for example, "Share of Daughter is 8.0 Million."

 

Hint: Use the round() function.

 

Note

The output should always be expressed in the unit "Million", as mentioned above.

Only the above 2 steps are to be followed while writing the code.

Printing the output will be taken care of while testing by creating objects for all the classes with sample inputs as arguments and calling the methods.

 

Input Format for Custom Testing

The first line should contain the value of 'total_asset'.

The second line should contain the value for 'Percentage of share of son'.

The third line should contain the value for 'Percentage of share of daughter'.

Sample Output

Share of Son is 2.4 Million.
Total Asset Worth is 10 Million.
Share of Parents is 5.0 Million.
Share of Daughter is 2.6 Million.
Total Asset Worth is 10 Million.
Share of Parents is 5.0 Million.

Output Explanation

In the end, the Boolean results are the result of printing isinstance() on objects created for different classes while testing your code.
