      (b)Now from the given date in input_date  add   microseconds using parameter ms , seconds using parameter se , days using parameter da and minutes using parameter mi using the datetime function in datetime module  and assign it in variable input_date1 and print it.

 

      (c)Now from the above date in variable input_date1  subtract one microsecond , two seconds,three days and two minutes and assign it in  variable t and print it.

     

      (d) Now from the variable t get the day and print it.

     

      (e)Now from the variable t get the year and print it.

 

      (f)Now from the variable t get the month and print it.

 

      (g)Now from the variable t get the minute and print it.  

     

      (h)Now from the variable t get the second and print it.   

 

 

(2) (a)Define a datetime format - for 3rd January 2020 (a friday) 10:34 in the morning with 24 seconds use 'Fri Jan 03 10 34:24 2020' and assign to variable s.

 

      (b)Assign the date using the parameters y, m, d, ms, se, da, mi (where y is parameter for year,m is parameter for month, d is parameter for date,ms is parameter for microseconds , se is parameter for seconds, da is parameter for day and mi is parameter for minutes respectively) to the variable x using datetime module  . Now using the format in variable s convert the date x into a string format and save it in variable q.

     

      (c)Now from variable q convert it back to datetime module and store it in variable z.
