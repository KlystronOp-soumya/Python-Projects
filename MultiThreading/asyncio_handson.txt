Asyncio - Basic asyncio program

 

Let's try out a basic asyncio program. Make two coroutines (functions with `async`) named `question()` and `answer()`.  `question()` should display three questions. After each question, it should await on `answer()` to receive the answer. The answer is the same for all three questions.

The questions that need to be displayed by `question()` are:
    "Is asyncio better for IO bound programs than the CPU bound ones?"
    "Is async a keyword in the latest Python3?"
    "Is event loop the heart of an asyncio program?"

`answer()` should contain just a `print()` giving the message `"Yes, it is!"`.


Make `question()` await on `answer()` to receive the answer.
The final output should be:
    Is asyncio better for IO bound programs than the CPU bound ones?
    Yes, it is!
    Is async a keyword in the latest Python3?
    Yes, it is!
    Is event loop the heart of an asyncio program?
    Yes, it is!

Use the sample programs in the course for reference, if needed.

 

Carry out the following tasks in serial order.

Task 1: Install dependency package

Open the terminal, File -> New -> Terminal. And run the following commands
python3 -m pip install pytest-asyncio
Task 2: Open the python and Write the solution

Open the main.py file available under the challenge directory and follow the instructions given.
Important Note:

Read every question properly and make sure you are saving the answer with the appropriate data type. 

 

Task 3: Testing the Questions

After completing the solution, Test your solution,
Open the terminal, File -> New -> Terminal. And run the following commands
python3 -m pytest -v test_main.py
It displays the number of test cases passed and failed.
Important Note: The results of the sample validation do not impact the final scoring. In-depth scoring will be done at a later stage.

 

Task 4: Submit the Solution

Once all test cases are passed, you can click on 'Submit' to submit your solution to hackerrank.
